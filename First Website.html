<h2>Farzat Selo</h2>

<p><h3>Short Story</h3></p>

<p>Hugh Jarse Morris is a 29-year-old professional sports
person who enjoys social card games, baking and eating
out. He is energetic and exciting, but can also be
very disloyal and a bit rude.</p>

<p>He is Welsh. He didn't finish school.</p>

<p>Physically, Hugh is not in great shape. He needs to lose
quite a lot of weight. He is very short with light skin,
brown hair and blue eyes. Unusually, he has a prosthetic
leg; a lion ate his.</p>

<p>He grew up in a working class neighbourhood. He was raised
by his father, his mother having left when he was young. 
He is currently single. His most recent romance was with
a carpenter called Iona Morgan Griffiths, who was the same
age as him. They broke up because Iona got fed up of how
Hugh talked to people.</p>

<p>Hugh's best friend is a professional sports person called
Ben Dover. They have a very firey friendship. He also
hangs around with Kai Warren and Rhian Daniels.
They enjoy yoga together.</p>
